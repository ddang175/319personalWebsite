            <p>Hi! I'm Danton, nice to meet you! I’m a dedicated sophomore pursuing a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering
                at Iowa State University, where I maintain a 4.0 GPA. Currently, I work part-time as a Software Engineer
                at John Deere. I'm also excited to join Principal Financial Group as an incoming Software Engineering
                Intern, where I’ll be expanding my skills and experience in the financial technology space. Passionate
                about coding, problem-solving, and teamwork, I continuously strive to build solutions that make a
                difference. Let’s connect!</p>

                <h3>Cyphonic</h3>
                <p>Cyphonic is an advanced web application developed to help Iowa State University students connect
                    based on their music preferences, leveraging data from the Spotify API. The platform provides an
                    in-depth look at users' listening habits, showcasing detailed stats on their favorite artists,
                    songs, genres, and more. With a focus on presenting users with an analysis of their music taste,
                    Cyphonic offers both an entertaining and insightful experience by giving users a better
                    understanding of how unique or “basic” their music preferences are.

                    At its core, Cyphonic utilizes the Spotify API to gather and display comprehensive data about a
                    user’s listening history. Once logged in with their Spotify account, users can instantly see a
                    breakdown of their most-played tracks, favorite artists, and favorite genres. Through this data,
                    Cyphonic not only showcases user statistics but also helps users discover new music through detailed
                    insights on their listening trends.</p>
